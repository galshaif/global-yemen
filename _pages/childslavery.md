In Islamic law, children born to enslaved women inherited their mothers’ slave status. The only exception to this rule were children born of unions between enslaved women and their masters. In this case, the children of [umm walads](/concubine), as such women were legally categorized, inherited the free status of their fathers and were considered full, legal heirs of the father’s estate so long as he acknowledged paternity.
