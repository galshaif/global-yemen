The “Yemen” perhaps most familiar to us is one situated at the foot of the Arabian Peninsula and within the confines of Middle East Studies. It is a Territorial Yemen that orients its histories northwards towards Mecca and the broader “Arab” and Islamic world. But what if we were to reorient Yemen southward towards the Indian Ocean? What histories might an “Oceanic Yemen” reveal that a Territorial Middle Eastern Yemen obstructs? When Yemen shares its world with East Africa, South Asia, and Southeast Asia instead of the Gulf and Levant, what individuals become newly included in the category of the “Yemeni”? The Oceanic Yemen Syllabus presents tools to help us grapple with these questions. </p>

<p align="justify">
An Oceanic Yemen does not deny the significance of the more familiar Territorial Yemen. Instead, an Oceanic Yemen is one of the multitudes of Yemens that The Global Yemen Project (TGYP) makes legible. It also makes legible Hadhrami merchants, African Zar priestesses, Adeni port workers, Jabarti street performers, Mokha coffee traders, and marginalized public servants as important historical actors. In this way, an Oceanic Yemen demystifies and de-exceptionalize both Yemenis and Islam to instead reveal an everchanging and fluid Yemen. </p>

<p align="justify">
However, Indian Ocean literature on Yemen also has its limits. Like Middle East Studies, it too presents particular histories of Yemen while marginalizing others. These histories are often limited to the social, economic, and spiritual lives of the Hadhrami male diaspora. Those histories that do explore non-Hadhrami Yemenis, often limit their scope to merchants and sailors’ engagement with oceanic religious and trade networks. When the social lives of women or marginalized Yemenis enter the Indian Ocean historiography, they are often the subject of a chapter or a subset of a much larger and often masculine history. Thus, scholars of modern Yemen must traverse the boundaries of area studies. Only through a thorough engagement with both Middle East Studies and Indian Ocean Studies can we understand the complex and rich social lives of Yemenis long absent in both scholarship. </p>

The collection of work included below begins to do this work. TGYP will continue to update this syllabus with monographs, articles, novels, and movies that educators and students alike can use to begin unraveling Yemen’s global histories. </p>
