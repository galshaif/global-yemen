Contrary to our present understanding of slavery in much of the modern Middle East, slaves in the Persian Gulf were commonly married to other slaves. Children produced by such unions were also slaves, and evidence suggests that part of the intention of such unions was to produce additional slaves, particularly as imported slaves became more difficult to come by.
