Her digital art featured here often center everyday Yemeni figures, both in Yemen and the diaspora, as they dance, work, grieve, and live. Her art reveals a multitude of Yemeni experiences that are not contained within the country’s borders. In featuring subjects both within and outside of Yemen, and like those works included in the Oceanic Yemen Syllabus, Noor’s art demonstrates Yemen’s globality beyond its territorial imagination.
