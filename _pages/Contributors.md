# Gokh Amin Alshaif
<p align="justify">
Gokh is a History PhD student studying the history of the modern Middle East. She specialize in race and gender in the Middle East, with a focus on the social history of Yemen. Her current project focuses on the social history of Al-Muhamasheen —Yemen’s marginalized African-diaspora. She seek to understand how the Yemeni revolutions of the 1960s cemented the Muhamasheen’s position on the margins of Yemeni society while these revolutions simultaneously called for the overhaul of the country’s social hierarchy. Through this project, and her previous degrees in Religious Studies, Political Science, and Global Studies, Gokh aims to provide an interdisciplinary case study to better understand race and race relations in the Middle East.
