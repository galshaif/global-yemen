      <h1 id="suaiyid-bin-hashim">Su’aiyid bin Hashim</h1>

<p>Su’aiyid bin Hashim was (1) born in Kurdofan, Sudan where he was then (2) kidnapped as a child by unknown men. He was then (3) taken to Mecca, Saudi Arabia and (4) sold there to Abdur Rahman bin Najim, a slave dealer. Abdur Rahman bin Najim then (5) sold Su’aiyid to a pilgrim and native of El Hasa in Saudi Arabia. Su’aiyid’s new master then took him from El Hasa to (6) Sharjah, UAE where he sold Su’ayid to Muhammed bin ‘Ali of Sharjah. After Muhammed bin ‘Ali death, his son, Abdull bin Muhammed bin Ali inherited Su’aiyid (7). Muhammed bin Ali, like his father, employed Su’aiyid as a pearl diver. However, Su’aiyid complained to the Muscat British manumitting authority that his master not only took all his earnings, but gave him insufficient maintenance (food), and treated him cruelly. Su’aiyid bin Hashim was thus (8) granted manumission at the Muscat, Oman office on October, 20th, 1937. His journey from the African continent across the Arabian Peninsula to the Persian Gulf is seen in Figure 1, and you can take a closer look of this journey <a href="https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/galshaif/cjt7odym02ddr1fmkeafi6wb9.html?fresh=true&amp;title=true&amp;access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoiZ2Fsc2hhaWYiLCJhIjoiY2pyaDFjMjl5MWgyYzQ5cXF2d3VlaWpjYiJ9.OEhQEgL1Bk34MgfDwHs5eQ#3.3/0.000000/0.000000/0">here.</a></p>

<h1 id="maryam-daughter-of-omar">Maryam Daughter of Omar</h1>

<p>Maryam Daughter of Omar took a slightly different path, though she too traveled across the Arabian Peninsula as can be seen in Figure 2. She was (1) born in Selali Fajjah, Abyssinia in around 1910 and (2) kidnapped from there by a slave trader named Musa. Musa then (3) brought her to Midi Village on the coast of Yemen where she was then (4) sold to Abdur Rahman of Qatar. Via land route, Abdur Rahman (5) transported Maryam to his native land of Qatar and then (6) via boat to Dubai. Maryam’s occupation seems unclear from her statement, but it does seem clear that she was not enslaved for long (less than a year). Citing her “forced and illegitimate enslavement,” Maryam (7) petition and was granted manumission in Sharjah, UAE on November 16th, 1925. Maryam’s journey is interesting for many reasons, but perhaps more so because she provides us with a rare insight to the experiences of female slaves in the Arab world. She, like many of the female slaves I came across, does not state her occupation. She does, however, like many other female slaves, request that she not be returned to her native land, because she is afraid that she will be re-enslaved. This request is interesting, because male slaves do not seem to make the same request despite facing similar risks. One explanation for this, and some other manumission statements seem to allude to this, is that the communities and families of these female slaves are reluctant to accept former female slaves back into their communities nor grant them protection due to their former slave status. Although we do not have much evidence to demonstrate that this is the case, it is definitely something I would like to further explore. You can explore Maryam’s slave journey closer <a href="https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/galshaif/cjt7of1cn04wx1fo8sht9vypc.html?fresh=true&amp;title=true&amp;access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoiZ2Fsc2hhaWYiLCJhIjoiY2pyaDFjMjl5MWgyYzQ5cXF2d3VlaWpjYiJ9.OEhQEgL1Bk34MgfDwHs5eQ#3.3/0.000000/0.000000/0">here.</a></p>

<h1 id="zayyud-bin-hasan">Zayyud bin Hasan</h1>

<p>Zayyud bin Hassan took a different path than that of Su’aiyid and Maryam as can be seen in Figure 3. Rather than traveling from East Africa across the Arabian Peninsula as they did, Zayyud traveled along the Swahili Coast and Persian Gulf like thousands of other slaves did. His journey is important in that it represents the more familiar route of the East African slave trade. This route travels from the Swahili Coast, often times from Dar El Salam, Tanzania or other times Zanzibar, to port cities of the Arabian Peninsula. In the case of Zayud bin Hasan, he was (1) born in Dar Es Salam, Tanzania  around 1856, and here he was (2) kidnapped as a child by inhabitants of Sur, Oman. The kidnappers (3) brought him to Las Al Khaimah, UAE where he was (4) sold Nasir bin Rashid al-Ali of Umm al-Quwai, UAE. His master (5) took him to Umm al-Quwai where Zayyud worked as a pearl diver at the Persian Gulf. He was enslaved by his master for approximately 60-65 years, and at 70 years old, Zayyud bin Hasan was finally (6) manumitted in Muscat, Oman citing his master’s ill treatment, insufficient maintenance of food and clothing, and his master’s confiscation of all his earnings. A closer look at Zayyud bin Hasan’s journey to manumission can be found  <a href="https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/galshaif/cjt7obhlc1gm91ft20g28i0m1.html?fresh=true&amp;title=true&amp;access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoiZ2Fsc2hhaWYiLCJhIjoiY2pyaDFjMjl5MWgyYzQ5cXF2d3VlaWpjYiJ9.OEhQEgL1Bk34MgfDwHs5eQ#3.3/0.000000/0.000000/0">here</a></p>

<h1 id="abdullah-alutaibi">Abdullah Al’Utaibi</h1>

<p>As you can see in Figure 4 below, Abdullah Al’Utaibi had a much more extensive and widespread slave journey than the three slaves introduced above. He was (1) born in Khartoum, Sudan in either 1873 or 1893—depending on which reported age you consider). Abdullah was then (2) kidnapped as a child by the Turkish army in Egypt and (3) brought to Dangala, Chad. He was then (4) sold to Hajji Ahmad al-Maghribi; however, he was able to (5) escaped from Hajji Ahmad and (6) went to Darab, Abbysinia where he remained for 2 years. Two years later, Abdullah was again (7) kidnapped by the Bishareyah tribe of Sudan and (8) brought to Jedda, Saudi Arabia where he was (9) sold to Abdullah bin Wasil for 1 year. His master then (10) sold Abdullah to Mutairi, a bedouin, for 6 months. While accompanying his new master in the desert, Abdullah was (11) kidnapped yet again by ‘Utaibah bedouins. The bedouins (12) sold him to Abdullah Izzir of Sha’arah of Najd, Oman where he remained for 2 months. Abdullah was then (13) brought to Hota, Saudi Arabia and (14) sold to Nasir bin Rashid for 3 months. Nasir bin Rashid then (14)  brought Abdullah to Qatar and (15) sold him to ‘Amer bin Khalfan who enslaved him for 2 years. After this period, ‘Amer bin Khalfan (16) sold Abdullah for the seventh time to Ali bin Thani of Qatar where he remained enslaved for 11 years and work as a pearl diver under harsh conditions. He escaped to the British Bahrain office where he submitted a formal request for manumission citing his master’s ill-treatment, the confiscation of all his earnings, and failing to provide sufficient maintenance (i.e. food and clothing.) Abdullah was granted manumission on July 17th, 1933. A closer look at Abdullah’s journey out of and back into slavery in the Arabian Peninsula can be found <a href="https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/galshaif/cjt7oh6zo6ohk1fr0qcoplu64.html?fresh=true&amp;title=true&amp;access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoiZ2Fsc2hhaWYiLCJhIjoiY2pyaDFjMjl5MWgyYzQ5cXF2d3VlaWpjYiJ9.OEhQEgL1Bk34MgfDwHs5eQ#3.3/0.000000/0.000000/0">here.</a></p>

<p>Abdullah’s story is interested for many reasons. The most obvious reason being that he managed to escape slavery, only to become enslaved again. Additionally, Abdullah was  kidnapped three times and sold and resold a total of seven times. In addition to his extensive journey, Abdullah’s manumission statement also offers us an interesting insight to the power that British officials’ biases exercised over manumission records. When Abdullah reported that he was 40 years old, the British officer was sure to clarify that although Abdullah “claimed” to be 40, he “looked” 60. Additionally, when Abdullah reported that his ethnicity was Sudanese, the British official was sure to add “appears negro.” This latter characterization was not reserved just for slaves from the African continent, but also to enslaved Arabs, many of whom were from southern Yemen. When these Yemenis reported that they were Arab, the manumitting authority was sure to add “Arab but appears negro”. Instances like these demonstrate the continual attempt to dehumanize slaves as well as rob them of the power to define their very identity even at the very moment when these slaves are exercising agency by demanding manumission.</p>
